# APC40_MKIIx
by chris joseph, xnamahx and others!  

A custom remote script for the APC40 MKII for Ableton Live 10. For the version that works with Ableton Live 11 please see: 
https://github.com/CJmusic/APC40_CJedit

Changes:

- user mode is a step sequencer
- nudge + + copies a clip 
- nudge + - deletes a clip 
- shift + nudge now nudges 
- shift + clip view is undo 
- shift + detail view is redo 
- shift + record is capture midi

Planned Changes: 

- shift + bank turns on VU meters 

Current Bugs: 
- Pads are always lit upon disconnect, velocity slider pads always lit (issue is with the make_button command ControlElementUtils.py)
- VU meters are leaking to other modes
